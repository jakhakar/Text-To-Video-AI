# In your main.py file:

# ... (imports and initial steps for audio and captions are the same)

# 1. Generate timed captions (this is unchanged)
timed_captions = generate_timed_captions(SAMPLE_FILE_NAME)

# 2. NEW STEP: Generate a detailed image prompt for each caption
# Note: We are using the new function 'generate_image_prompts_timed'
timed_image_prompts = generate_image_prompts_timed(timed_captions)

# 3. NEW STEP: Fill any gaps where the API might have failed
# Note: We are using the new function 'fill_empty_prompts'
timed_image_prompts = fill_empty_prompts(timed_image_prompts)
print("Final timed image prompts:")
print(timed_image_prompts)

# 4. Generate the video clips using the new prompts
# The 'generate_video_assets' function will now receive the list of enhanced prompts.
# It will loop through this list and generate an image for each prompt.
generated_clips = generate_video_assets(timed_image_prompts, VIDEO_SERVER)

# 5. Render the final video (this part remains the same)
final_video_path = get_output_media(SAMPLE_FILE_NAME, timed_captions, generated_clips, VIDEO_SERVER)
